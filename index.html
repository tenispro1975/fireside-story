          <p>It was a dark and stormy night... There was a young man, drinched in sweat. He glared at the whited board and trembled with fear from the pain he was about to indure.....</p>
          <p>The idea of doing 21-18-15-12-9-6-3 thrusters and bar facing burpees was almost too much for him to fathom.  Oh and there was a 25 minute time cap, YIKES!!!</p>
          <p>As he scanned the room looking at his competition, it began to make his heart beat faster as if the 10 second count down clock had already started.</p>
